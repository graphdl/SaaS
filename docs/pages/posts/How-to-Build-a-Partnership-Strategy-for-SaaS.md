# How to Build a Partnership Strategy for SaaS

Partnerships can make or break a SaaS (Software as a Service) company. A great partnership can take your business to the next level, while a bad partnership can lead to lost time and resources.

Building a successful partnership strategy is about understanding your business, identifying potential partners, and creating mutually-beneficial collaborations. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to build a partnership strategy for SaaS, and provide some tips and tricks that can help you succeed.

## Understand Your Business

Before you can start building your partnership strategy, it’s important to understand your business. You need to know your target audience, your unique value proposition (what makes your product or service stand out), and your overall business goals. This information will help you identify the types of partnerships that will be most beneficial.

For example, if your target audience is small business owners, you may want to partner with other SaaS providers that offer complementary services to yours, such as accounting software or project management tools. If your unique value proposition is ease of use, you may want to partner with companies that offer training or onboarding services.

## Identify Potential Partners

Once you have a firm understanding of your business, it’s time to start identifying potential partners. This can be done through research, networking, and referrals.

Start by researching companies in your industry that offer complementary services to yours. Look for companies that share your target audience and have values and goals that align with yours. You can also attend networking events, participate in online forums or groups, and reach out to your existing customers or partners for referrals.

When identifying potential partners, consider the following factors:

- Relevance: How relevant is the partnership to your business? Does it align with your overall goals and target audience?
- Compatibility: Does the potential partner share your company’s values and goals? Will you be able to collaborate well together?
- Reach: How far reaching is the partner’s audience? Will partnering with them help you reach new customers or markets?
- Resources: Does the potential partner have resources that can benefit your business? For example, do they have a large marketing team or a vast network of contacts?

## Create Mutually-Beneficial Collaborations

Once you’ve identified potential partners, it’s time to start creating mutually-beneficial collaborations. This means finding ways to work together that benefit both your business and your partner’s business.

There are many different types of partnerships that SaaS companies can create, including:

- Co-marketing: This involves partnering with another company to co-promote each other’s products or services. For example, you could create a joint marketing campaign, host a webinar together, or co-write a blog post.
- Co-selling: This involves partnering with another company to sell each other’s products or services. For example, you could offer your product or service as an add-on to your partner’s product, or vice versa.
- Integration: This involves partnering with another company to integrate your products or services. For example, you could integrate your accounting software with a project management tool.
- Referral: This involves partnering with another company to refer each other’s products or services to customers. For example, if you offer a project management tool, you could partner with a company that offers time tracking software and refer customers to each other.

When creating partnerships, it’s important to keep the following in mind:

- Benefits: Make sure the partnership benefits both your business and your partner’s business. Identify how each of you will benefit, and make sure that the benefits are worthwhile.
- Contracts: Put the details of the partnership in writing, including any financial or legal considerations. Make sure you have a solid contract in place to protect both parties.
- Communication: Communication is key in any partnership. Make sure you have open lines of communication with your partner, and that you’re both on the same page about goals, timelines, and expectations.

## Maintain and Grow Your Partnerships

Creating a successful partnership is just the first step. To see the benefits of the partnership, you need to maintain and grow it over time. This means keeping in touch with your partner, measuring the success of the partnership, and looking for opportunities to expand or improve the partnership.

To maintain and grow your partnerships, consider the following:

- Regular check-ins: Check in with your partner regularly to ensure that the partnership is meeting both of your needs. This can be done through monthly or quarterly calls, emails, or in-person meetings.
- Metrics and tracking: Set metrics and goals for the partnership, and track your progress over time. This will help you identify areas for improvement and measure the success of the partnership.
- Opportunities for growth: Look for opportunities to expand or improve the partnership over time. This could mean creating a new joint marketing campaign, offering new add-ons or integrations, or exploring new markets together.

## Conclusion

Building a successful partnership strategy for SaaS companies involves understanding your business, identifying potential partners, creating mutually-beneficial collaborations, and maintaining and growing those partnerships over time. By following these steps and keeping communication open with your partners, you can create partnerships that benefit your business and help you achieve your overall goals.
