# Workflows

Workflows are a sequence of states that represent a business process. A workflow can be used to 
model a business process that is not supported by the standard processes in the system. 
For example, a workflow can be used to model a process that is specific to a particular 
business unit or a process that is not supported by the standard processes in the system.
